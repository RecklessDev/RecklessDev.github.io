Although it is using placeholder art I managed to create a Match 3‚Äù concept in Unity.
As of now the game is quite basic.

**Match 3 concept in Unit 3D**

The idea is simple: matching 3 elements on the same type and level will create an element of the same type with a higher level. 
I struggled for about 45 minutes to reach a level higher than 3 and was a bit fun.

After I get the time to refactor the code I may also publish the framework here

Next milestone on my plan: support matching based on an arbitrary set of rules.
