Calling the code below multiple times, under certain circumstances, will cause a crash.

{% highlight csharp linenos %}
private Dictionary<Cell, IBlockEntity> _board;

public void RemoveBlock(IBlockEntity block)
{
    var location = _board.FirstOrDefault(pair => pair.Value.Equals(block)).Key;
    Despawn(block);
    _board[location] = null;
}
{% endhighlight %}


The above snippet is a minimal version of the actual code I was debugging from which I stripped some method calls and parameter validity checks, but even so, I spent way more time than I want to admit in fixing the issue. In my defense the code is much bigger than this and I wasn't sure where the error is, but stillâ€¦
