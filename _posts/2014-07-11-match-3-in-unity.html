title: "Match 3 in Unity"

<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<p>Although it is using placeholder art I managed to create a “Combine 3” concept in Unity.</p> <p>As of now it looks as follow:</p> <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-dpfX04r0Zhs/U8AhbFSfouI/AAAAAAAAAYE/YBtwgbnbMrQ/s1600-h/unity_combine_3%25255B2%25255D.gif"><img title="unity_combine_3" style="display: inline" alt="unity_combine_3" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ig5b1IohreM/U8Ahb8aqPzI/AAAAAAAAAYM/8ss1g-SCwmg/unity_combine_3_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="186" height="240"></a> </p> <p>The idea is simple: matching 3 elements on the same type and level will create an element of the same type with a higher level. I struggled for about 45 minutes to reach a level higher than 3 and was a bit fun.</p> <p>After I get the time to refactor the code a bit I will also publish it here; if it has enough interest maybe put in on the Asset Store for anyone to use.</p> <p>Next milestone on my plan: support matching based on an arbitrary set of rules.</p>
