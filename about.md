[![Nice to meet you](/images/avatar.jpg)](/images/avatar.jpg)
**Well... me**
{: class="post-image post-image-right"}

My name is Sebastian. Sometimes I use **`memleak`** or **`recklessdev`** as internet nicknames. 

In real life, I am a software development engineer, working mainly with C++. Here, I am a careless developer creating video games and blogging about programming, design and anything else that will come to my attention and is related to game creation.

# But why RecklessDev as the blog name?

As I mentioned, I am actually a programmer. I write stuff that supposely compiles. And, I admit that at first I wanted to use a name such as `AwesomeDev`, `BestCodeEver` or `AmazingDeveloperWhoWritesAmazingCodeAlthoughEveryoneKnowsIsNotAlwaysTrue` the truth is those characteristics are really not yet to be found in this profession. If I think at programming in general, `reckless` is one of the first words that comes into minds.

Reckless, not because we don't know what we do (although lots of developers really have no idea what they're doing), we don't have the knowledge and experience to do better or maybe because we don't care but really because we are driven by the immediate results and solutions and much less by what tomorrow lies.

Is not a bad thing. Is quite awesome actually.
